# UFO’s
## Fact or Fiction

The debate of whether or life exists on another planet has been going on for decades.  Most people remember E.T., Star Trek and Star Wars as one of the first instances of seeing life on other planets depicted in the movies.  There are many people that believe that there is life on other planets.  However, due to the inability to accurately and sufficiently prove their belief some people are viewed as “crazy”.  Well crazy or not, we have been able to compile data with specific information in regard to UFO sightings across the world.  

We have developed this website to have all of our data in a central location and allow the user to judge for themselves in regard to whether or not aliens actually exist and also whether or not they are trying to contact us.  Upon arriving at the website, you will see where you are able to conduct a search based on several options.  You can choose 1 or all of them depending on how specific you want you want your results to be.  As you can see in the image below, we have selected the state of California.  After pressing enter on the keyboard we see that the filtered results are being shown based on our request.


 
	
Although the data is plentiful, there is 1 drawback.  We only have data from the month of January in the year 2010.  Our next steps for further development are to continue to add data either for additional years or perhaps just continue to gather data for the year 2010.  We are also working to modify the website to provide video confirmation (when applicable) for each sighting that we have on record.  We know that video confirmation when strengthen our case and also help to validate what we believe.  We are not alone.
